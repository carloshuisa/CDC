## What our project does overall
Our project provides county-level comparisons on the social vulnerability index (SVI), along with insights into how national disasters and COVID are related to SVI. In order to focus on those populations who may need the most help in the future, we forecasted potential deaths from COVID-19 by vulnerability level. We hope this project can help public health officials and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that will most likely need support. Further, we hope it helps them prioritize their limited resources for the tracts in need most before any hazardous events.

## How we built our project
We first completed some basic exploratory analysis to understand the data set, including computing summary statistics of variables and imputing missing values. We then visualized the SVI of each NC county in each theme and tried to explain these distributions using other variables within the dataset. Ultimately, we realized that it would be valuable to combine the SVI data with external data sets, so we completed the further analysis using US disaster and COVID-19 data sets.

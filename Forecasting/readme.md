# Project Forecasting
## COVID-19 Death Forecasting
We created a predictive time series model to forecast COVID-19 deaths after October 31, 2020, for each Vulnerability Level. We created our three forecasting models using LSTM ( Long Short-Term Memory), getting good prediction metrics: RMSE (0.0204%) and MAPE (7.9%) on average. 

Then we predicted the deaths due by COVID-19 for the following 75 days after October 31, simulating a scenario where vaccines weren't distributed among the population. We found that the forecasting for the High-Vulnerable group increased its COVID-19 deaths exponentially, showing that populations with fewer opportunities and more vulnerable can suffer disastrous consequences when facing disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
